 * HOW TO SEND FILES CORRECTLY:

 * 3. Send the data with tox_file_senddata(...) with chunk size tox_filedata_size(...)
 * 4. When sending is done, send a tox_file_sendcontrol(...) with send_receive = 0 and message_id = TOX_FILECONTROL_FINISHED
 *
 * HOW TO RECEIVE FILES CORRECTLY:
 * 1. wait for the callback set with tox_callback_file_sendrequest(...)
 * 2. accept or refuse the connection with tox_file_sendcontrol(...) with send_receive = 1 and message_id = TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT or TOX_FILECONTROL_KILL
 * 3. save all the data received with the callback set with tox_callback_file_data(...) to a file.
 * 4. when the callback set with tox_callback_file_control(...) is called with receive_send == 0 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_FINISHED
 * the file is done transferring.
 *
 * tox_file_dataremaining(...) can be used to know how many bytes are left to send/receive.
 *
 * If the connection breaks during file sending (The other person goes offline without pausing the sending and then comes back)
 * the reciever must send a control packet with receive_send == 0 message_id = TOX_FILECONTROL_RESUME_BROKEN and the data being
 * a uint64_t (in host byte order) containing the number of bytes recieved.
 *
 * If the sender recieves this packet, he must send a control packet with receive_send == 1 and control_type == TOX_FILECONTROL_ACCEPT
 * then he must start sending file data from the position (data , uint64_t in host byte order) recieved in the TOX_FILECONTROL_RESUME_BROKEN packet.
